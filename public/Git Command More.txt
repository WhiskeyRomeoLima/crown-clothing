***** STEPS IN MAKING CHANGES *******

git branch <branch name> : adds a branch

git branch  checkout <branch name>  : moves head to branch name

(make changes to files)

git add .    : adds all files with changes in Staging Area

git commit -m "message" :  commits changes

git push  : push changes to remote

*********************************************************

***** STEPS IN DELETING BRANCHES (local, remote) *******

git checkout main : make sure HEAD points to <branch name> before the deletes

git branch -a : list all local and remote branches

git branch -d <branch name> : deletes a local branch

git push origin --delete <branch name> : deletes a remote branch


Setting up a new Git Repo
##Create a new repository on the command line

Quick setup — if you’ve done this kind of thing before
or	
https://github.com/WhiskeyRomeoLima/<repo>.git
Get started by creating a new file or uploading an existing file. We recommend every repository include a README, LICENSE, and .gitignore.

…or create a new repository on the command line
echo "# <what ever" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/WhiskeyRomeoLima/<repo name>.git
git push -u origin main

…or push an existing repository from the command line

git remote add origin https://github.com/WhiskeyRomeoLima/<repo name>.git
git remote add origin https://github.com/WhiskeyRomeoLima/jammming.git

git branch -M main
git push -u origin main


Actually, the first line of the instructions will say
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/username/new_repo

But I use git@github.com:username/new_repo rather than https://github.com/username/new_repo, as the former is for use with ssh (if you set up ssh as I mentioned in “Your first time”, then you won’t have to type your password every time you push things to github). If you use the latter construction, you’ll have to type your github password every time you push to github.
